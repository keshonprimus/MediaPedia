This Project is designed, developed, and engineered to provide a local media outlet store in Tampa Bay with an effecitve and efficient way to manage their stock and supply of goods. Currently, the store has no digitized way to keep track of their products, and customers lack a convenient way to search the store's website for products. To ensure that both the client and customer's needs are met, a dual-system was deigned to provide functionality to both ends of the business.

This project therefore produces an application that fullfils the following business needs and addresses the following pain points:
  1. Convenient method for customers and employees to access products via a centralized dashboard
  2. Employee portal that grants employees with exclusive access to the business views of the store's property and inventory detailing.
  3. Convenient lookup times and edit times for product inventory by employees.
  4. Extensible product database to monitor and regulate store inventory.
  5. Clean and Easy Mapping from Mthe online store's website to the dashboard.
  
Note: This project is currently protoyped. Further testing before deployment is required. System testing with the media outlet store pending approval.

To run this project: 
cd inventory 
pip install django 
python manage.py makemigrations 
python manage.py migrate 
python manage.py runserver
